#notes for algebraic topology and its prerequisite point-set topology,maybe helpful for whom wish to learn algebraic topology 

##required stuff from point-set topology according to answers from quora:

###deconstructionist topology (slogan borrow from "essential topology")
homomorphism::T->T
disjoint union:T+T->T
product :T*T->T
quotient:T/dT->T

###some topological properties
connectedness,components and local connectedness
compactness

the above is assumed to be sufficient for the learning of algebraic topology

path connectedness (a example for intuition)
homotopy as equivalence classes
homotopy classes of the circle (a crux and unusual example to grasp the concept of homotopy,because the group of it is not trival)
homotopy groups and the fundamental group

fibrations and cofibrations

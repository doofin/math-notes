#according to robert harper,Hott = intentional martin-lof type theory(ITT) * univalence axiom(UA)* higher inductive types (plus higher inductive-inductive types)

##ITT:

##UA:
  a convenient tool to simplify calculations on univalent universes

##HIT
  strengthen expressiveness of ITT,make it laconic to represent algebraic structures like free group and much more

Additionally,Hott is a much concise and lucid meta theory to do set-theoretic logic.for example:a proposition in set theory corresponds to a type with 1 element,whose transition is done via so called "proposition trunction",and that type is literally called "mere proposition",which means that its data is merely dependent on its two possible state of inhabitation.Also,the chaper of the hott book on set-theoretical logic is relatively easy to read

the prerequisite of the Hott book which is also the solitary book on this subject:
abstract algebra(group,free group,category theory)
algebraic topology (fibrations,continuity)
